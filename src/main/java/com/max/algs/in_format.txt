We are using the Community Write pattern.
There is no public write access, except for leaving page comments. You must be registered and logged in to leave comments.
Please do add page comments when a page should answer your question but doesn't. (That means, potentially on any page.)
The most effective page comments will include links to relevant email discussion threads, e.g., on the Hotspot compiler-dev list.
Any member of the OpenJDK Hotspot Group or a related group should feel free to contribute.
Actually, anybody with a (demonstrable) working knowledge of the Hotspot internals will be welcome to contribute content.
Write permissions are not automatic until and unless the DBs get on speaking terms. If you think you should have write permission and don't contact the wiki administrator.
