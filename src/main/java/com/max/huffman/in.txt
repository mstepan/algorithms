A binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or other data using any two-symbol system,
but often the binary number system's 0 and 1. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits (bits) to each
character, instruction, etc. For example, a binary string of eight bits can represent any of 256 possible values
and can therefore represent a variety of different items.

In computing and telecommunications, binary codes are used for various methods of encoding data, such as character
strings, into bit strings. Those methods may use fixed-width or variable-width strings. In a fixed-width binary code,
each letter, digit, or other character is represented by a bit string of the same length; that bit string,
interpreted as a binary number, is usually displayed in code tables in octal, decimal or hexadecimal notation.
There are many character sets and many character encodings for them.

A bit string, interpreted as a binary number, can be translated into a decimal number. For example, the lower case a,
if represented by the bit string 01100001 (as it is in the standard ASCII code), can also be represented as the decimal
number 97.
